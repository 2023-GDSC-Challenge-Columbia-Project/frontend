## ðŸ¥‘ Introduction

Hi, we are Avocay!

We wanted to develop a mobile application that advocates womenâ€™s reproductive rights and justice because many women lack resources regarding their reproduction. We thought about our problem locally, aimed at women in New York, and wanted to avoid gender stereotypes. Our app Avocay wanted to provide a safe place and helpful resources for women going through unexpected pregnancies. 

## ðŸ¥‘ Our UN Goals

We want to contribute to the two UN Sustainable development goals, Good health and gender equality. 

## ðŸ¥‘ A Tech Stack

We use Flutter/Dart with Google Maps API.

## ðŸ¥‘ Features

Feature Overview
1. Dashboard 
<img width="337" alt="Dashboard photo" src="https://github.com/2023-GDSC-Challenge-Columbia-Project/frontend/assets/94277988/080cbe7e-c2ee-41ee-93e7-0e4c83ed54e8"> 
The first page a user will see is the Dashboard with the two white tiles and bottom navigation bar. Users can navigate to any desired page--Nearby Resources Bookmarks, Related Articles Bookmarks, Pregnancy Calculator(a calendar icon), Related Articles(a search icon), Nearby Clinics(a map icon), and Settings(a settings icon). By pressing the avocado in the middle of the navigation bar, users can return to the Dashboard anytime.

2. Pregnancy Calculator
Let's say a user pressed a calendar icon in the navigation bar, then our app will guide the user to pick the date on the calendar to calculate the pregnancy week. 

4. Related Articles
Users can choose categories of articles they want to see. 
6. Nearby Clinics
When users press a map icon in the navigator bar, then they will see markers on the map, which are clinics. They also can find out how to get to the clinic and how long it will take.
