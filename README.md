## ðŸ¥‘ Introduction

Hi, we are Avocay!

We wanted to develop a mobile application that advocates womenâ€™s reproductive rights and justice because many women lack resources regarding their reproduction. We thought about our problem locally, aimed at women in New York, and wanted to avoid gender stereotypes. Our app Avocay wanted to provide a safe place and helpful resources for women going through unexpected pregnancies. 

## ðŸ¥‘ Our UN Goals

We want to contribute to the two UN Sustainable development goals, Good health and gender equality. 

## ðŸ¥‘ A Tech Stack

We use Flutter/Dart with Google Maps API.
